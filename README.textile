h1. jquery-ensure

h2. What is it?

A jQuery plugin to ensure that a specified jquery method/behavior gets applied to DOM elements that are dynamically added after the initial page load.

h2. Methods

h3. ensure(method, [args])

Applies the method (such as 'click', 'css', or any other jQuery method) immediately and whenever new content is added dynamically.  Any number of additional arguments can be supplied and will be passed along to the method.

h2. How do I use it?

Let's say you have a click handler defined like this:

<code>$('.do_something').click(function() { alert('something') });</code>

Ensure it like this:

<code>$('.do_something').ensure('click', function() { alert('something') });</code>

Any content added to the page will handled automatically:

<code>$('body').append('<a href="#" class="do_something">click me</a>');</code>

Note that ensure only supports "simple" selectors that are supported by jquery's <code>filter</code> method.  In particular, this means you cannot use hierarchical selectors.  Instead, use a context refine your scope:

<code>$('#some_div').find('.awesomeness').ensure(doStuff);<code>

h2. Isn't this the same as "livequery?":http://brandonaaron.net/docs/livequery/

It's very similar but with fewer features.  I certainly got a lot of inspiration from livequery.  My goal with jquery-ensure is to meet the same need that livequery met for me with a more simplified API and without the features I didn't need.
